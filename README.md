# Rydeu.com React Native Coding Challenge

## 1. Goal

Your goal is to build a react native app that displays a list of Boos for an inputted Auther. We will provide guidelines and feature requests below, but ultimately the design and functionality of your app is up to you. Keep in mind functionality and code quality is more important than asthetic design.

## 2. Instructions

** How to Submit your challenge**
Follow these instructions to submit your challenge.

Setup your Development Environment (React Native - Getting Started guide)
Clone the Challenge Repository
Create a dedicated branch
Write your Code
Commit your Changes
Fork the Challenge Repository
Issue a Pull Request

Please read through the rest of the requirements and additional info before working on your app.

You can refer to the [getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) if you need help initilizing a new react native project. We would prefer if you did so **without** using Expo, however the choice is ultimately up to you.

Alternatively, if you do not have an environment in which to work on a React Native app, you can use https://snack.expo.io/.

If you are still having problems please email manoj@rydeu.com.

You can use third party libraries, but the more code you write yourself, the better.

You have 3 days to submit your code, however we want to be respectful of your time and do **not** expect you to work for more than **3 hours** on this challenge.

When you are finished please submit a .zip file with your entire project (node_modules included) to manoj@rydeu.com (or a link to your expo snack project).

## 3. Basic Requirements

 * Your app should have a text input that allows a user to enter an Auther name in the format `"{First name}, {Last name}"`
 * Your app should fetch data on books that published by Auther, using the (https://openlibrary.org/search/authors.json?q=bill%20gates) (see more below)
 * Your app should display these books as a list, you can include whatever information about each books you would like
 * Your app should run on iOS or Android

## 4. Bonus Features

 These features are **absolutely not** required, however if you finish your project early and wish to continue here are some ideas:
  * Implement "pull to refresh" on the list
  * Implement validation on the text input, so users see an error if they attempt to submit a malformatted address
  * Include a "share" button on each search result that allows you to send a link to the restaurants home page to a friend using the share dialog
  * Keep a history of previous address searches (double bonus if it persists between app launches)

## 5. Using the Auther API
You can use below link for auther api spec.
https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/authors

For simplicity please only use the following Authers:
Bill Gates
J K Rowling

**What will we evaluate?**
Code quality
Usage of patterns
Networking code
Language skills
Project structure
